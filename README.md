# AADCF (Actually A Decent Chat Filter)
This is a Minecraft Plugin that combats the problem with many servers, bad chat moderation/filters,
Sometimes a server will be using ChatSentry (as an example, no hate to them) and it'll be censoring the most randomest words you've ever seen being censored.

AADCF is designed to be fully customizable & able to support the latest versions of Minecraft

Currently, you can put in a list of words through `/plugins/AaDCF/config.yml` - This is subject to change.

## Features
Word blocking (more is coming)
